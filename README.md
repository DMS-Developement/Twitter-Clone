## Mini Tweet: A simplified Twitter clone built to demonstrate a full-stack application using C#/.NET, Angular, and PostgreSQL. Features user authentication, tweet posting, and more.

**Introduction**

This portfolio project serves as a simplified Twitter clone designed to showcase skills in full-stack web development. Built using Angular, C#/.NET, and Supabase, the application emulates key functionalities of Twitter but in a stripped-down manner.

**Objectives:**

The primary objectives of this project are to:

- Understand and implement User Authentication in a web application.
- Practice CRUD (Create, Read, Delete) operations.
- Implement following and feed functionalities to explore relational data structures.
- Develop a seamless front-end experience using Angular.
- Work with Postgres databases through Entity Framework Core in C#/.NET.
- Learn about deployment and iteration in software development.

**Features:**

- **User Authentication:** Simplified, yet secure, sign-up, login, and logout functionalities. (**Progress:** Still have to implement Logout function)
- **Tweeting:** Allows users to freely express themselves through creating, reading, and deleting tweets. (**Progress:** Currently wiring up frontend button)
- **Following:** Cultivate a network by following and unfollowing other users. (**Progress:** Backend logic is done, just have to add button on the frontend)
- **Feed:** Experience a curated feed of tweets from your network. (**Progress:** Completed ‚úÖ)
- **Profile:** A snapshot of each user's activity and details. (**Progress:** Frontend build in progress)

**Upcoming Features:**
